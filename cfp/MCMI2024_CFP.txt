Goal
***********************************************************************

The MCMI workshop aims to explore the convergence and fusion of information from multiple modalities, forming the backbone of modern AI systems for robust pattern recognition and understanding. This interdisciplinary workshop encourages collaboration across fields such as audio processing, computer vision, and natural language processing. It serves as a venue to discuss recent findings, share innovative methodologies, and address future directions in multimodal pattern analysis. Such integrative approaches are crucial not only for academic research but also for technological advancements in the industry, transforming how we interact with the world and fostering new possibilities for innovation.

***********************************************************************
